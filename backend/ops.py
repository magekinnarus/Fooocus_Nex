# Nex-native Ops Bridge (Stub)
# TODO: Implement Mission P3-M09 (Loader Rebuild) here.

"""
Mission P3-M09 Target:
This module will isolate the 'precision casting' logic from ldm_patched/modules/ops.py.

Core Logic to Implement:
- Base class for Nex-compatible operations.
- Linear and Conv layers that handle input-driven weight upcasting (refer to brain/P3_technical_discovery_precision.md).
- Removal of model_management.py dependencies by using backend/resources.py instead.
"""

# For now, this is just a flag to preserve discovery knowledge.
